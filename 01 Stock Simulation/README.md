# Multi-Stock Price Simulation — Stage 4

**Project:** Simulating and visualizing multiple stock price paths using Python  
**Author:** Viraj Nigwekar  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To simulate and visualize price paths for multiple stocks using random returns and compounding — building intuition for volatility and stock behavior.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts Learned  

### 🟢 2-Stock Simulation  
- Used `np.random.normal` to generate daily returns  
- Applied `np.cumprod` for compounding prices over time  
- Learned basic visualization using `matplotlib`  

### 🟣 5-Stock Simulation  
- Extended simulation to **5 stocks** with different volatilities  
- Stored stock parameters in a **dictionary**  
- Plotted multiple stock paths on a single graph  

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used  
- **Python**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**  
- Run in **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Key Insight  
Even with simple random models, multiple stocks behave differently due to volatility — introducing the idea of **diversification** and **portfolio behavior**.
