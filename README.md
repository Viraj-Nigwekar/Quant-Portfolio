# 🧠 Quantitative Finance Learning Journey

> A structured, end-to-end progression through quantitative finance — from Python foundations to full portfolio optimization and research.  
> Built using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **SciPy**, and real-world market data via **yfinance**.  
> Each stage is coded and documented in Google Colab with analytical explanations and visualizations.

## 📊 Overview

This repository documents my step-by-step journey into **quantitative finance**, combining programming, statistics, and portfolio theory.  
The goal: build deep intuition for how markets behave, how risk and return interact, and how mathematical ideas translate into financial models.

## 🧩 Stage-wise Progression

### **Stage 1 — Python Foundations**
- Core syntax, logic, loops, conditionals, and functions.  
- Building algorithmic thinking and comfort with code structure.

### **Stage 2 — Automation & Scripting**
- Practical projects from *Automate the Boring Stuff*.  
- Strengthening problem-solving and file/data handling skills.

### **Stage 3 — Numerical Computing (NumPy)**
- Arrays, vectorization, broadcasting, and random sampling.  
- Computing statistics efficiently and visualizing distributions.

### **Stage 4 — Data Visualization & Analysis**
- Using **Matplotlib** + **Pandas** for time-series plots.  
- Exploring daily returns, trends, and volatility visually.

### **Stage 5 — Single-Stock Monte Carlo Simulation**
- Implemented **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** for price paths.  
- Studied randomness, compounding, and volatility dynamics.

### **Stage 6 — Multi-Stock Simulation & Portfolio Visualization**
- Extended GBM to simulate multiple correlated assets.  
- Visualized multi-asset evolution and diversification benefits.

### **Stage 7 — Portfolio Statistics & Diversification**
- Computed covariance / correlation matrices.  
- Quantified risk relationships and portfolio stability.

### **Stage 8 — Markowitz Portfolio Optimization**
- Constructed the **Efficient Frontier** using real market data.  
- Optimized for **Sharpe ratio** and **minimum variance** portfolios.  
- Applied optimization algorithms (SLSQP) and shrinkage estimators (Ledoit–Wolf).  
- Visualized frontier, weights, and risk–return trade-offs.

### **Stage 9 — Backtesting & Performance Evaluation**
- Tested optimized portfolios on out-of-sample data.  
- Measured cumulative returns, drawdowns, and real-world robustness.

### **Stage 10 — Research & Model Extension**
- Developed mini-projects on **risk parity**, **factor models**, and **regime analysis**.  
- Wrote technical summaries and insights for each experiment.

### **Stage 11 — Quantum & Advanced Quant Research**
- Exploring **quantum-inspired optimization** and **AI-driven** modeling.  
- Integrating computation, finance, and research curiosity.
