# 🧠 Quantitative Finance Learning Journey

A structured, end-to-end progression through quantitative finance —  
from Python foundations to full portfolio optimization, backtesting, and regression-based research.

Built using **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy**, and real-world market data via **yfinance**.  
Each stage is coded and documented in **Google Colab**, combining analytical reasoning with clear computational implementation.

## 🧾 Abstract
A 10-stage progression through quantitative finance — from stochastic simulation and diversification to portfolio optimization, backtesting, and regression analysis.  
Each module demonstrates key mathematical and computational concepts through reproducible Python notebooks.

## 📊 Overview
This repository documents my progression into quantitative finance, combining programming, statistics, optimization, and financial modeling.

**Goal:**  
To build intuition for how markets behave, how risk and return interact, and how mathematical ideas translate into practical, testable models.

Along the way, I’ve implemented concepts ranging from random price simulations to covariance shrinkage — all through reproducible code and statistical reasoning.  
While formal derivations (e.g., Itô’s Lemma, optimization proofs) will be studied later in undergraduate coursework, the focus here is on intuition and computational verification.

## 🧩 For Reviewers

I am currently seeking professional feedback on:
- Technical accuracy of portfolio optimization and regression stages  
- Code clarity and documentation quality  
- Suggestions for extending this work into a formal research study  

Please feel free to open an **Issue** or reach me at **virajnigwekar@gmail.com**.

## 📖 Notes
This repository reflects an ongoing learning process rather than a finished research project.  
While I continue formal study of the underlying mathematics, each stage is tested, simulated, and verified through data.

---

## 🧭 Vision
To understand the mathematics of uncertainty,  
to build systems that measure and manage risk,  
and to connect programming with financial insight.
