# 🧠 Quantitative Finance Learning Journey
A structured, end-to-end progression through quantitative finance —  
from Python fundamentals to portfolio optimization, backtesting, and regression-based analysis.

This repository documents my technical growth, mathematical formalization, and early research work in quantitative finance.  
All work is reproducible through Google Colab notebooks.

## 🧾 Abstract
A multi-stage progression through quantitative finance, combining stochastic simulations, diversification concepts, portfolio optimization, backtesting, and regression/factor modeling.

The emphasis is on:
- building mathematical intuition,  
- implementing models rigorously in Python,  
- validating ideas through data,  
- and developing a research-oriented workflow.

Formal mathematical foundations (linear algebra, probability, statistics, and optimization) are being strengthened in parallel through MIT OCW and other academic sources.

## 📊 Overview
This repository reflects my long-term progression toward quantitative finance and applied mathematical modeling.

My goals are:
- to understand how markets behave under uncertainty,  
- to analyze how risk and return interact,  
- and to translate mathematical ideas into empirical, testable models.

While I continue formal study of the underlying theory, each stage is supported by simulations, code, and statistical reasoning.

## 🧭 Current Focus
I am currently:

- formalizing my mathematical foundations through MIT OCW (linear algebra, probability, and optimization),
- and working on my first research project on **robust portfolio optimization**.

The research goal is to analyze how estimation noise affects Markowitz portfolios and to evaluate methods that improve stability and out-of-sample reliability.
