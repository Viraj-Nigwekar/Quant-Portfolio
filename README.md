# 📈 Quantitative Finance Learning Journey

A structured and rigorous progression through quantitative finance — 
from Python fundamentals to multi-asset simulation, portfolio optimization, 
backtesting, and regression-based factor analysis.  
All work is implemented in Google Colab using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, 
and real market data via `yfinance`.

This repository documents my growth as a student working toward mathematical 
maturity, statistical intuition, and research-level modeling skills.

## 🧾 Abstract
A 10-stage progression through quantitative finance, covering stochastic 
simulations, diversification, portfolio construction, optimization techniques, 
backtesting frameworks, and regression/factor analysis (CAPM, FF3).  
Each stage is supported by reproducible Python notebooks, structured analysis, 
and clear documentation.

I am currently formalizing my mathematical foundations through MIT OCW 
(Linear Algebra, Probability, Optimization) and other university-level sources, 
while beginning early research work in robust portfolio optimization.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this repository is to understand how mathematical ideas translate 
into practical financial modeling — how randomness evolves, how risk is 
quantified, and how portfolios can be constructed, tested, and evaluated using 
real data.

While advanced theoretical tools (e.g., stochastic calculus, convex analysis) 
will be studied formally in the future, the present focus is on clarity, 
intuition, and empirical rigor through simulation and validation.

This project reflects an ongoing journey — not a finished result — and is 
continuously improving as I study more mathematics and deepen my research skills.
