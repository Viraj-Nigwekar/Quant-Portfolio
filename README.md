# 🧠 Quantitative Finance Learning Journey

A structured, end-to-end progression through **quantitative finance** —  
from Python foundations to full portfolio optimization, backtesting, and regression-based research.

Built using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **SciPy**, and real-world market data via **yfinance**.  
Each stage is coded and documented in **Google Colab**, blending analytical reasoning with intuitive explanation.

### Abstract
A 10-stage progression through quantitative finance — from simulation and diversification 
to portfolio optimization, backtesting, and regression. Each module demonstrates 
core mathematical and computational concepts through reproducible Python notebooks.


## 📖 Notes
This repository reflects an ongoing learning journey rather than finished research. 
While I continue to formalize my mathematical background, each project is 
implemented and verified through simulation, code, and data.

## 📊 Overview

This repository documents my **step-by-step journey into quantitative finance**,  
combining programming, statistics, optimization, and financial modeling.

The goal:  
to build deep intuition for how markets behave,  
how risk and return interact,  
and how mathematical ideas translate into practical, testable models.

Along the way, I’ve implemented many concepts —  
from stochastic simulations to covariance shrinkage — intuitively and computationally.  
While I don’t yet know every formal derivation (like Ito’s Lemma or optimization proofs),  
I aim to **build mathematical fluency from the ground up** through coding and experimentation.

Right now, I’m also preparing for **JEE**, and managing my **health** —  
so I haven’t yet been able to study every proof or theorem in full detail.  
But I intend to learn the mathematics **rigorously in undergrad**,  
to understand not only how these models work, but *why* they hold true.

This project reflects a student still learning the “why” behind the formulas —  
but already exploring how those formulas behave in the real world.

## 🧩 Stage-Wise Progression

### **Stage 1 — Python Foundations**
- Core syntax, loops, and functions.  
- Building algorithmic thinking and comfort with structure.

### **Stage 2 — Automation & Scripting**
- Projects from *Automate the Boring Stuff.*  
- Strengthened data handling and logic fluency.

### **Stage 3 — Numerical Computing (NumPy)**
- Arrays, vectorization, random sampling.  
- Efficient statistical computation and visualization.

### **Stage 4 — Data Visualization & Analysis**
- Time-series plots using Matplotlib + Pandas.  
- Explored returns, volatility, and trends visually.

### **Stage 5 — Single-Stock Monte Carlo Simulation**
- Implemented **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** for price paths.  
- Studied randomness, compounding, and volatility.

### **Stage 6 — Multi-Stock Simulation & Portfolio Visualization**
- Simulated multiple correlated assets.  
- Visualized diversification and cross-asset behavior.

### **Stage 7 — Portfolio Statistics & Diversification**
- Computed covariance and correlation matrices.  
- Quantified risk relationships and portfolio stability.

### **Stage 8 — Markowitz Portfolio Optimization**
- Constructed the **Efficient Frontier** using real market data.  
- Optimized for **Sharpe Ratio** and **Minimum Variance** portfolios.  
- Applied **Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage** for stable covariance estimation.  
- Visualized risk–return trade-offs and weight dynamics.

### **Stage 9 — Backtesting & Performance Evaluation**
- Tested optimized portfolios on in-sample / pseudo-out-of-sample data.  
- Measured cumulative returns, drawdowns, and performance metrics.  
- Discovered **regime sensitivity** — how stability in training affects robustness.

### **Stage 10 — Regression & Factor Modeling (Current)**
- Moving from *“how portfolios perform”* → *“why they perform.”*  
- Implementing **CAPM** and **Fama–French** regressions to analyze portfolio drivers.  
- Measuring **alpha**, **beta**, and **factor exposures** to interpret risk sources.  
- Building explanatory frameworks connecting math, markets, and behavior.  

### **Stage 11 — Quantum & Advanced Quant Research (Planned)**
- Exploring **quantum-inspired optimization** and **AI-driven portfolio modeling.**  
- Integrating computation, finance, and research curiosity.

## 🧭 Vision

To understand the **mathematics of uncertainty**,  
to build systems that **measure and manage risk**,  
and to connect **programming** with **financial insight**.

I’m not a mathematician yet —  
but I’m learning to think like one.  
Coding helps me see patterns; mathematics helps me explain them.  
Even though JEE preparation and my health sometimes limit how much I can study,  
my long-term goal is to **learn the full mathematical structure rigorously** in undergrad —  
to connect the beauty of theory with the clarity of practice.

> *Optimization builds structure. Regression explains it.*
